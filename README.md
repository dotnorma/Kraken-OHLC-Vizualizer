# Kraken-OHLC-Vizualizer

This project hooks into Kraken's Rest API to pull, parse, and vizualize OHCL (open, high, low, close) market data in a GUI. This project's primary purpose is to demonstrate proficiency in Python,
as well as competency with common data parsing/vizualization libraries (JSON/matplotlib/pandas) and gui toolkits (tkinter/ttk).
